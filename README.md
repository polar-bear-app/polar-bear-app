# Polar Bear

Polar Bear helps you run a desktop Linux environment on your Android device.

**Note**: It is expected that you already have a usable desktop experience, i.e., a large enough display (tablet or DEX), a physical keyboard, and optionally a mouse/trackpad. **Polar Bear aims to bridge the gap between the two platforms, not trying to "simulate" the desktop experience by introducing inconvenient interactions**.

## How it works

1. An Arch Linux ARM64 filesystem is set up inside the app's internal storage.
2. Proot is used to mount the filesystem and "chroot" into it.
3. A built-in Wayland backend is started inside Android via NDK.
4. Weston is started inside Linux and renders to the Wayland backend as a nested Wayland compositor.

## Features

- Standalone: Polar Bear is not a set of instructions on how to setup a Linux environment using Termux. It is a standalone app that provides a streamlined Linux experience on Android.

- Rootless: Polar Bear does not require root access to run.

- FOSS: Polar Bear is free and open-source. A paid version exists to fund development and maintenance. There is no runtime difference between the free and paid versions.

## Requirements

- Android 8.0 (Oreo) or higher (minSdk 26).
- ARM64 architecture (unless you're using an emulator, you're probably fine).

## License

Polar Bear is open-source and available under the GNU General Public License v3.0. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for more information.

Have you ever spotted a penguin in the Arctic? Itâ€™s about as surprising as running a Linux application on Android!
